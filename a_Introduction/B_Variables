#1 Variables :

- Variable is used to store the data temporarily while processing.
- Variable is a type of box in which you store data and a type is attached to it such as type can be number, text, image, etc. Thus, a box is known as a variable and a name and value are present with it.
- A variable is a container that holds the value while the Java program is executed.
- Java is a strongly-typed language as it demands the declaration of every variable with a data type.

- Syntax of creating a variable:
 datatype variable name = value;
 int num1= 3;
- Here, (=) is the assignment operator that takes the right-hand side value and assigns it to the left-hand side.

- println is used to go or print on the new line.
- In Java, every statement ends with a semicolon except blocks.

public class hello {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print(3+5);
		System.out.print(8+7);
		
		//int num1=3;
		//int num2=5;
		//System.out.println(num1+num2);
		
		int num1=3;
		int num2=5;
		int result=num1+num2;
		System.out.println(result);
