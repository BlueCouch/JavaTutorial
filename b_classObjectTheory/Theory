#1
Java is Object- Oriented Programming:-
- In the real world, everything is an object like a pen, mouse, glass, etc.
- Every object has two things:
  - An object knows something ( It has some properties)
 - An object does something( It has a behaviour)
- Every object has a property and behaviour. It can also have multiple properties as well as multiple behaviours.
- To create an object, first, we need to create a class.
- Class act as a blueprint that contains the designing of an object.

#2
- JVM creates objects in Java.
- JVM creates an object but it requires a blueprint.

- Thus, you create a class file that class file gets compiled to create a byte code and that byte code goes to the JVM and then JVM creates an object.

class Calculator {

    int a;

    public int add(int n1, int n2) {
        int r = n1 + n2;
        return r;
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        int num1 = 4;
        int num2 = 5;

        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        int result = calc.add(num1, num2);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
