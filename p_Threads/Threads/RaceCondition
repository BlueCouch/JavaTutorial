Mutation simply means you can change something.
int i = 5 you can mutate this by incrementing, decrementing

What if thread and mutation wants to work together

Use Threadsafe - Only one thread can work at one time

class Counter {

    int count;
    public synchronous void increment() { // THis increment will call only one at a time
        //Only because of this we get consistent count of thread
        count++;
    }
}

public class Demo {
    public static void main (String a[]) throws InterruptedException {

        Counter c = new Counter();

        Runnable obj1 = () -> {
            for(int i=1; i<=1000;i++) {
                c.increment();
            }
        };
        Runnable obj2 = () -> {
            for(int i=1; i<=1000;i++) {
                c.increment();
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(obj1);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(obj2);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println(c.count);

    }
}
